Just `make` and see what is missing ;)

mongodb is required. You may want to set yourself as an administrator, which 
can be done by:
`db.whitelist.updateOne({username:"YOUR_USERNAME"}, {$set:{admin:true}})`.

Due to the cache in the server, you'd probably have to restart the server.


For aarch64 (Release):
```
mkdir -p aarch64-build
cd aarch64-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --toolchain ../cmake/pv4-aarch64.cmake ..
make -j8
```
